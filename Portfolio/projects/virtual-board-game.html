        <p class="project-intro">
          A digitally implemented board game focused on strategic decision-making,
          resource tension, and emergent player interaction.

          <li><strong>Role:</strong> Game Designer</li>
          <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Systems design, balance, player interaction</li>

        <h2>Design Goals</h2>
        <p>
          The primary goal of this project was to translate the strengths of
          physical board game design into a digital format without losing
          clarity, tension, or player agency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Emphasis was placed on readable systems, meaningful trade-offs,
          and mechanics that encouraged interaction rather than isolation.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Core systems -->
      <section class="project-section fade-in">
        <h2>Core Systems</h2>

        <p>
          The core mechanics revolved around shared resources, asymmetric player
          roles, and turn-based decision structures that created emergent
          strategic outcomes over repeated play sessions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Systems were iterated through frequent playtesting to ensure balance
          while preserving distinct player identities.

      <!-- Iteration -->
      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Iteration and Balancing</h2>
        <p>
          Early versions of the game suffered from dominant strategies that
          reduced long-term engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through structured playtests, mechanics were adjusted to introduce
          counterplay opportunities and dynamic shifts in power throughout
          the game.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- What I learned -->
      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <p>
          This project strengthened my understanding of systemic balance and
          the importance of iteration informed by player behavior rather than
          designer intention alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also gained experience adapting traditionally physical design
          problems into digital systems while maintaining accessibility
          and depth.
