           A narrative-driven RPG prototype exploring elements of pan-asian culture,

        <h2>Design Goals</h2>
        <p>
          The primary goal of this project was to explore various pan-asian cultures,
          inter pretting them and seeing how they build the game's world and mechanics.
        </p>
        <p>
          The crucial point of this project was deciding on the importance of cultures of art;
	  dance and music, and the roles they would play in both gameplay and narrative.
        </p>

        <h2>The Heart of The Project</h2>
        <p>
          The project would be nothing without the amazing and creative people
	  who contributed their unique thought processes, creativity and determination.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the original concept, artworks, gameplay, etc were things I came up with,
          the project would remain just another idea without my amazing team members behind it.
        </p>

      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <p>
          This project taught me the importance of team work, that sometimes ambition should be left
	  behind in favour of a better product, a work of art. Managing and teaching my team also educated me
          on matters of team leading, conflict resolution, and project management.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also gained experience balancing narrative ambition with systemic clarity,
          ensuring the player never felt lost even when outcomes were ambiguous, that they
          remained immeresed in the game world.
